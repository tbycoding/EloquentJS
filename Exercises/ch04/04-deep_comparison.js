/* **Instructions**
Write a function that takes two values and returns true only if they are the same value or are objects with the same properties, where the values of the properties are equal when compared with a recursive call to the function. Use they "typeof" operator to find whether values should be compared directly or have their properties compared, if it produces "object" for both values, do a deep comparison */
